    <string name="elyrics_waikato">The river is Waikato\nGrab it, squeeze the juice for yourself\nGrab some water for yourself
            \nIt heads to the Gulf of Waikato\nThe river; bending down, monsters\nIt\'s a monster, a monster\nBe careful not to turn around\nWaikato was strong\nKeep your eyes on the distance\nTaupiri is the mountain\nPeople are equal\nThe national identity e
            \nTake your boat to Ngaruawahia\nLegacy for the whole world\nMatutaera\'s last fertilizer

            Ka eke ki Te Pūaha o Waikato\nTe awa; he piko, he taniwha\nHe piko, he taniwha
            \nKia tūpato rā kei tahuri koe\nI ngā au kaha o Waikato\nWhakamau tō titiro ki tawhiti rā\nKo Taupiri te maunga\nPōtatau te tangata\nTe mauri o te motu e\nE hoe tō waka ki Ngāruawāhia
            \nTūrangawaewae mō te ao katoa\nTe tongi whakamutunga a Matutaera
            \nAuē hoki auē</string>
    <string name="desc_waikato">Mr Harrison, the author of this poem, writes that \'When working on the different hydro works on the Waikato River,
            I spent quite a few hours of leisure, marvelling at the greatness of the dams and lakes formed on this waterway.
            So, in my spare time i made up this poetry about the Waikato River\'.\n\n

            This was published in the historical Te Ao Hou magazine in June 1962, issue 29. Over the years, there have been slight adjustments
            to the poem to suit the context of todays\'s communities. Wintec only sings the first three verses.</string>
